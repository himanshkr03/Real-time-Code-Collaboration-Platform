# Real-time Code Collaboration Platform

## Description
The Real-time Code Collaboration Platform is a web application that allows multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time. It utilizes Socket.IO for real-time communication and React for building the user interface. This platform is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration among developers, making it easier to work together on coding projects from different locations.

## Features
- **Real-time Code Editing**: Multiple users can edit code simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time.
- **Integrated Chat Functionality**: Users can communicate through a chat interface while collaborating on code.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and management (if implemented).
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced readability of code with syntax highlighting using Monaco Editor.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on various devices, ensuring accessibility.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Real-time Code Collaboration Platform, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-code-collaboration-platform.git
   cd real-time-code-collaboration-platform
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Client Directory and Install Client Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install

   npm run client
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to start collaborating!

## Usage
- Users can create or join a coding session and start editing code together.
- The integrated chat allows for real-time communication, enhancing collaboration.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
